I don't know how to start this subject. I guess why I am doing this right :) I like to be emphatic to people as much as I can. I believe in, people could be good and live in harmony as a community. You can call me little hippie headed but this post is just about that.

I don't like to point people's mistake/s; cause it makes me feel like I am above them. Which is a shitty place to be. I just want people to see how they got controlled. Their ego and being right takes place and blurs their view.

I feel like this is new way to control people. It is based on one of the oldest strategy: Divide and conquer. But right now instead of conquering they just want you to occupy your mind with pointless subjects that will not help anyone. Moreover it will effect your daily life by putting your thoughts into containers. They are labeling containers as they go.

I know I am not clear but I don't want to jump into subject. Let's start from one of the easy subject. They polarise people by making them choose between Apple and Google as in mobile Operating Systems. You either 'Apple fun boy' or 'Apple hater'. It could be in reverse. If someone is using Iphone 'Apple haters' will call them out on different points. Best way to avoid this; just stop caring about the result. Focus on who benefiters out of this fight. I think Apple and Google are just buddies that happy to share the market. If you have big enough competition there is no 3rd one that can enter the scene.

This benefits "them" (secret lizard people) because they can control people's freedom. What I mean by this; recently these 2 companies agreed that they are gonna put "infected tracking" systems to their OSes. Which brings big concerns about privacy (I know they are already tracking everyone) But this time you are gonna tracked and this data going to be shared with governments and third parties (maybe) who wants to advertise. But people still divided between "Best Phone Software". There is no best they both have pros and cons. Stop focusing on that. They want you to fight over your $1000 phone with your friends so that you feel like a winner in your head.

Same thing is happening in politics, sports, cars, laptops... you name it. Every major company figured that they can control the market if they have only one competitor (so it is not against law in USA(I know jackshit about Law)). Stop falling into this trap. Stop fighting over Mac or PC (I hate this term Mac is a freaking pc, after all it is a freaking personal computer right? you can't say mac vs pc laptop. It just don't make any sense. (look at me loosing my temper over one misused term and talking about unity)) They want you to fight over this stuff so both can do whatever they like. Choose the independent way. I am not going to pitch about Linux (i know) at least not on this post :)

This is the same in politics as well you have two options and you can be either one of them. Don't you see it is impossible to be right about everything. If you feel like you are the one side. Stop PROTECTING it. They want you to fight over their ideas and you put your name behind it. No matter how absurd they are.

Polarisation brings obedience. You cannot choose from 2 because they are serving the same cause. They want you to be occupied over protecting their products or ideology. If your so called leader says something don't stand behind it mindlessly, step back look at it and say that he or she might be wrong on this one. This units people. If your so called 'opponent' sees the weak sides of the competition and admits about them. You will stop competing and will try to find middle ground.

This so called territorial thinking is so immature and divides people. Stop protecting the ideology based on who said it. Just try to unite against the common enemy that trying to polarise us.

Lastly; thing it is as in fashion, you call it ridicules when you first see something really absurd. Over time you start dressing like that because fashion demands you to dress like that, other wise you are not fashionable person. Ideas are not like fashion you can not just follow what is popular. (i have no idea about fashion but this is the least delicate subject i think)

I love you all, just know that Polarisation brings fanaticism and that brings crafted happiness. Crafted by the people who already polarised us. Because they don't want us to get in touch with happiness within <3

title: Economical or Viral
---

  People are realizing that our virus problem is causing something bigger. Economically most of the countries are going to get destroyed. Middle man and small business going to get it much, much worse. I think this is the first time in history, both money losing its value,people are scared to spend it and also the job market is dry as a desert.
  Whatever hopeful idea you had in your mind about the solution is gone now. IF you are one of the people who are lucky enough to keep their jobs, you should settle whatever you have. Because this recession is going to make the job market more and more competitive than ever. In my case, who have to have a part time job because of the limitations, can not even find any job advertisement in big websites. If you were relying on your hospitality carrier, I feel really bad about what happened. It is not even people's fault.
  Noone knows anything about the end game, it looks like we have to change our habits. Which can be a good thing. This society was sick anyway. What I am scared of is; people who were really law abiding citizens are in trouble. Not the big greedy, dirty companies. I guess whoever has the most wins the most anyway whatever the circumstances are.
  I hope you are staying mentally and physically safe

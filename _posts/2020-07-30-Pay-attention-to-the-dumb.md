 People need to understand that they only have one view of the world. For us everyone and everyone’s views are considered ‘others’. We love putting them into categories and label them. I guess it is because our ape brains want everything as easy as possible. 

 If you are thinking that you are different, let me tell you : you are not. You have to put really big effort into taking labels off. I am not talking about labeling people, I am talking about labeling ideologies, especially the opposing ones. If you think that you are so ‘open minded’, tell me when was the last time you sat down with the opposite views and ask them about their views, just to understand.
	
  I did this recently with my biggest thought pillars: religion and politics. Religion was not as hard as I expected. I went there voluntarily, tried to understand them and open their deeper thoughts. I went there for more than 2 weeks not just once, keep that in mind. At the end, I kind of envy religious happy people. I don’t have to tell you my beliefs since we are on the internet you know which one it is.
	
  Other pillar was harder than I expected. I think it was harder because I was overestimating my knowledge about politics. I am not going to tell you my political views, because you can already tell. (This is a blog post ;) ) I thought there is no reason to listen to the right wing, I am not talking about mainstream politicians, right wing opinionated celebrities. I always thought that they were right wing because they were rich and their compass points at money at all times. Oh boy, wasn’t I a judgemental piece of shit. Listening and reading about underlying thoughts about ideology behind it changed my views greatly.Being young and believing in the socialistic ideas is the hip thing to do. You think that humanity will get better with socialism. Let me tell you, people shouldn’t be in comfort. Because they get lazy and unproductive really fast. If there is no production, there will be no value in the big image.(family, community, country, you name it)
	
  I am not going to go deep into my experience. I just want you to try to find some source about ideas you are against. It will shake your mind and open it. Trust me sounds cliche but just try once.
	
  After all, you can’t be right about everything. Other people have some good points against you, don't forget that.

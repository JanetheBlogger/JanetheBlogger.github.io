It is really weird how adaptable we are. We get used to pretty much everything. I can't put my finger on it tho. Is it an advantage, are we the greatest in evolving? or is it a disadvantage, our water can be heated up and we think it is a sauna.

Sometimes I think it is our biggest coping mechanism. If we weren't this much adaptable, we would be in a lower place in the pyramid. Think about it, you are an ape descendant (I know) and you ride a block of metal at 100 km per hour, and you get bored and try to text or scroll instagram. Just break it down you will see how crazy and unusual it is for us. No one thinks about this while they are driving.

It sounds like we are adapting to increase our living quality, but it is not just that. Imagine someone is captive in a war or something like that, they could get tortured for a long time. No one thinks about getting tortured on their day to day lives. Still when they need the internal guidance, power, will it still hang in there. There are some horrible stories about people getting messed up treatment from bad people, they still hang in there.

On the other side of the adaptation, people adapt to technology or fashion with no question asked. Anything that comes up in the 'fashion world' people adapt to it. Tight skinny jeans for men were absurd a couple of years ago. But now wearing them is just normal as wearing a shirt. Why don't people go and say 'This is absurd and uncomfortable, I am not gonna wear this'. Or in the technology world ridiculous things go as well. For the sake of innovation.

My writing is not improving but at least my brain fog is released by brain fart. It gets better overtime they said, that's what I am doing. Stay safe out there and be independent.

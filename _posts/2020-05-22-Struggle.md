  It has been a while, but I am gonna try to keep it up. This blog thingy helps me clear my mind. Also it's a chance to let it out.
  Current situation in job market is so bad for everyone. Due to what is happening currently around the world. It is so weird that people getting into conspricies more and more. I don't blame them because it feels like some reptaile ordered this in order to contol humanoids. My problem is personal. I am trying to survive by myself. In this situation nothing is helping, job market is dryer than a stoner's mouth. (I think this was my first joke ever) 
  I am thinking about starting my own business, because at this stage no one is willing to hire anyone. So I have to create my own opurtunity. I always think about creating my own job, maybe this is a chance for me to try it out. You know if I was so comfortable with a job I would't think this.
  Anyway, I need to think about what I need to write. Before this turns into dear diary. Wow... I didn't make any spelling mistakes. Way to go me :)

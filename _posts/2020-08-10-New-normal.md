 I try to stay away from common problems. When I say common, common for today’s world, not common as everyday world. This is so interesting that 2020 is like the weirdest year ever happened to us. (I can’t say to humanity because I am realistic) People lost their lives, jobs, sanity and hope for being normal again. I don’t know if you noticed or not but, handshake is weird as seeing a mom kissing their kid on the lips. Frankly it is weirder than that.
 
Sometimes before I go to bed, I think about my expectations and how far I am. I would guess that we would be more connected with the help of the internet. Because when I was little (early days of the internet) going into IRC channel was exciting. It was a connection to the outside. I always got excited to talk to strangers. But right now the internet is a giant marketing tool for big corporations. People don’t see how much ad they see on the internet. I can notice it because on my computer I don’t see any advertisements. Looking at someone else's computer is really weird for me. I don’t know if you noticed it but, when you watch TV at this time (after not watching it for years) you notice that it is just a big advertisement with some stuff in between. Right now the internet is the same for me. Browsing a website is like looking at an ad on the side you get some other stuff. Maybe I am super sensitive to ads, but this cannot be the new normal.

I think the problem is, we are so adaptable to things. Would you believe that handshakes would be weird a year ago? Now it is weird all the time. Even when I see a movie and people hug and stand in the crowd I get weird out by it. How weird is that. I always think about ‘wow..if this was happening right now, they would all get the beer virus.’ Just watch Metallica concert, you will see what I am saying. It is crazy that social animals get weirded out by crowds.

This is going to be unrelated to the topic. It is just a small rant. How pointless is this scientists and their works. Not all of them, but most of them doing jack shit but people consider them as scientists. Just look at the academic writings and do research about stuff. You will see that they are not doing anything, just applying rules to useless shit. I believe that universities are doing the same thing in more organized ways. They are teaching you to be unproductive in many ways. I don’t believe we will get anymore freeballing scientists like Tesla. Because they have to be in universities teaching people how to be unproductive. Or maybe trying to apply new way of referencing. What a waste of human energy and resource.

Sad thing is we are forced to play these games, we are forced to be obedient to the new normal. After all we are like monkeys dancing around mindlessly.

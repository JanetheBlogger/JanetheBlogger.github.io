title: Creating

  I wasn't expecting to run out of stuff to say, but I think I am too busy at the moment to write something interesting. Good thing is now I understand how hard it is to be a content creator. People (me as well) take it for granted, they see a video from a big youtuber and assume that it is so easy to just sit there and create content.
  Think about how picky you are to watch a content on the internet. Even websites can get elliminated if they do not strike as at the first moment. Think about how hard it is to create audiance, create content for them, make them stay with you. It is hard, not like a mine field worker hard, but still hard to handle it everyday.
  My life is changing its direction at this moment. I am scared that I am rushing to my goals, in the end point is to get there right?

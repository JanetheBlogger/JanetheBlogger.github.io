The temptation of taking the bait. People can't help themselves to not take the bait. I know I do that as well but just hear me out for a second.

I am gonna give example from the subjects that I know. Let's talk about consumer products that does not make sense, but people buy it anyway. Other group of people judge them based on their behavior. How do I know it? Because I am one of them, at least I am aware that I am feeding the beast and I am trying to get away from this mind set. I cannot give detailed example because it will be against what I am trying to prove.

This goes back to what I was trying to say by polarization. I know I am beating the dead horse, but for me it will make a big difference if we all can understand the importance of it. 
Here how it goes : One brand who you like something absurd and you have to protect the way they act, because you feel attach to that brand. You go into arguments with people that does not share the same view as you do. Just stop this, stop publishing and marketing products that will not bring any benefit to you.

People get offended if you say something about by their choice of brand, and they get defensive about it. You should stop talking about things that will not effect you and you 'brand protector' stop talking about that brand, because at the end none of this matter. They want you to do this and stop being a pawn to a game. Just do whatever you like. Keep it in mind that, who ever designed the product "badly" gets paid more than you, has bigger team and spend more time on it. Sure there is some disasters but they all do it on purpose.

I am sorry I keep getting into materialistic subjects, I promise next one would be different. I just get upset when people get polarized from things that does not effect them, or no benefit to them.
